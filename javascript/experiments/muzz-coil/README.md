# Muzz Coil


Muzz Coil is an integration of the Coil game with [muzzley](http://www.muzzley.com) technology.

Muzz Coil an addictive HTML5 game where you have to defeat your enemies by enclosing them in your trail. Most of the game is drawn on 2d canvas but if WebGL support is detected additional effects are added.

The integration with muzzley was possible by replacing the "mousemove" events for the actions coming from muzzley.

The original Coil game are available on: [Coil](https://github.com/hakimel/Coil)
