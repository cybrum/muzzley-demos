# Muzz Racer
==========================

An Outrun-style pseudo-3d racing game in HTML5 and Javascript, that was integrated with [muzzley](http://www.muzzley.com) technology.
The integration was based on game available on: [javascript-racer](https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-racer).
The integration with muzzley was possible by replacing the directional keys events from keyboard, for the actions coming from gamepad widget.



A note on performance
=====================

The performance of this game is **very** machine/browser dependent. It works quite well in modern
browsers, especially those with GPU canvas acceleration, but a bad graphics driver can kill it stone
dead. So your mileage may vary.

Currently supported browsers include:

 * Firefox (v12+) works great, 60fps at high res - Nice!
 * Chrome (v19+) works great, 60fps at high res... provided you don't have a bad GPU driver
 * IE9 - ok, 30fps at medium res... not great, but at least it works
